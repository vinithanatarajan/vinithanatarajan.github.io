          <h2>Pairing</h2>
          <p>Pair programming has been nominated several times in the last decades as an improved way of developing software. Prior to my first pair programming experience I was very reluctant to program with another person and thought it was out of my comfort zone. But in my first pair programming session I came to know that it is learning to work together.</p>

<p>By working together, we learn ways to communicate more easily and we communicate more often. This raises the communication bandwidth and frequency within the project, increasing overall information flow between us. Rotating partners increases the overall information flow farther. I found this experience was more enjoyable than working alone.</p>

<p>I took couple of hours to solve challenges by my own and figuring out stuff like how to get tests running takes time. Discussing and working together in pair programming we try to find problems that can be broke down into stages, so even if we can't solve the entire problem, we can get through one of the stages and feel we've accomplished something.</p>

<p>All of these are likely to increase team effectiveness. Overall I would describe pair programming as "more than twice as fast".</p>
