          <h2> Stereotype Threat and Women's Math Performance </h2>
          <h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
          <p>Stereotype threat is a self-confirming belief that one may be evaluated based on a negative stereotype. </p>

          <h3> Women's maths Performance </h3>

          <p>Considerable research over the past decade has shown that women's performances on math tests are compromised by stereotypes. When women perform math, unlike men, they risk being judged by the negative stereotype that women have weaker math ability.</p>
          <h3>My Experience</h3>
          <p> I am not an exception from the above case. I did poorly in math in primary and secondary school when compared to my older brother who is as good in math. He was labelled best in math by my parents. Though I had the ability to do my best I beleived I would never perform better than my brother. This threat affected my achievement initially but later I found that I was just not interested in mathematics and I didn't give it a real chance. By developing a little involvement I was able to score 80% in math exams.</p>
          <h3>How Stereotype threat affects?</h3>

          <li>Stereotype threat impairs performance by inducing anxiety</li>
          <li>stereotype threat appears to undermine achievement through disidentification.</li>
