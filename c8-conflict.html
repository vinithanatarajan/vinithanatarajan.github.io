          <h2> Conflict </h2>

          <p>Conflict should be viewed as neither positive nor negative. Instead, it is an opportunity to identify differences that may need to be addressed when dealing with customers. It is not unusual to experience conflict when dealing with someone else. In fact it is normal and beneficial as long as you stay focused on the issue rather than personalizing and internalizing the conflict. When you focus on the individual, or vice versa, conflict can escalate and can ultimately do irreparable damage to the relationship.</p>

          <p> As I have experience working as a manager in a fast food restaurant I had to face conflict with the customers several times. I would like to point out an incident which happened recently in the new year day. It was a really busy day and I was left with only four staffs including me. There was a big queue lining up in front counter and at the same time cars lining up in drive thru. Imagine how hard it would be to serve them all with few staffs. Some orders took too long to be served. Customers were complaining about the speed of service and some wanted refund. I gave them a refund and apologised for the wait.</p>

          <p> The source of conflict was less staff. I always try to see things from the customer point of view. Perhaps I would also feel upset if I am in the same situation. It is important to manage customer's expectation and take the necessary steps to avoid arguments, disputes and other form of conflict.</p>
