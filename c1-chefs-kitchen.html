          Hello Everyone, I am very glad to say that I am a student at EDA. I am also happy to be a member of Pukeko community where I get connected to all the amazing people who have the same interests as me and can help with my future career. 

EDA is embedded with excellent teachers' teaching and supervision practices which systematically supports learning in students. After watching Shereef's fireside chat I realised that I was completely in a consumer mode with a Restaurant mindset. But after going through week 1 learning material, it encouraged me to independently search for information, analyse and apply it in novel ways, as well as to generate new information.
Now I believe that I am slowly moving towards the creator mode with a kitchen mind set. I am confident that this mindset will last in me for life time.

EDA provides with both learning and teaching experience and also provides students with constructive feedback with their learning and skills. EDA programs were exactly what I was looking for. And of course, thanks to EDA, finally I get to meet you.
