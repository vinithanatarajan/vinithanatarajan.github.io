          <h2> test-driven development (TDD) </h2>

          <p>Test-driven development (TDD) is a method of software development in which unit testing is repeatedly done on source code. The concept is to "get the code work now and refactor it later." After each test, refactoring is done and then the same or a similar test is performed again.</p>

          <p>In simple words TDD can be done in four simple steps. The first step is to add a test.  Next you run your tests, you may decide to run only a subset, to ensure that the new test does in fact fail. You then refactor your functional code to make it pass the new tests. The fourth step is to run your tests again. If they fail you need to update your functional code and retest. Once the tests pass the next step is to start over.</p>

           <p>Our natural approach to development is to write a code to implement a functionality in mind. Once we finish coding, we test then modify if an error is found and test again. This cycle continues. TDD is upside-down approach for non-TDD developers. In TDD you write test first rather than production code.</p>

           <h3> Benefits of TDD </h3>

           <p>Automated testing: As system is getting bigger and complex, people are moving to automated testing. Automated system makes the testing much more easier and faster. Manual testing is slower and needs human interaction which is error-prone. Automated testing makes sure any particular test is not missing every time we test the system, whereas human may leave a test out mistakenly during testing process.</p>

           <p>Better to test New Functionality: With manual testing whenever you add new functionality or modify existing functionality, Quality Assurance personal needs to test all systems that may be affected due to the modification which may be time-consuming. This may also leave a hidden bug in the system after modification. With TDD whenever a new functionality is added or existing functionality is modified, the whole set of tests in the system is run to make sure existing tests are passed.This makes sure that existing functionality is not broken.</p>

           <p>Better way to fix bugs: In TDD approach when QA finds a bug, developer first writes a test that generates the bug (that is the test will fail due to this bug). Then developer modifies code to make sure that the test is passed (i.e., the bug is fixed). This approach makes sure that next time the bug will not appear in the system as a test is written in the system to take care of the bug.</p>

           <p>Repetition of the same bug reduced: With TDD once a bug is found, it's put under test. So every time you run the whole test in the system, the tests associated with the bug are run and make sure the bugs are not generated again.</p>

           <p>By reading the above section, I hope you are convinced that TDD is the best as it offers so many benefits.</p>
