          <h2> Exploring My Values </h2>

          <p>In Week 7, we've been challenged to consider what our "values" are. Below is my opinion.</p>

          <p>When I think of the times in my life where I've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind.</p>

          <p>Independence, Persistence, Personal development, Reputation, Responsibility, Self-respect.</p>

          <p>In general, I try to live up to the above values:</p>

          <p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>

          <li>Independence - 4</li>
          <li>Persistence - 5</li>
          <li>Personal development - 5</li>
          <li>Reputation - 5</li>
          <li>Responsibility - 5</li> 
          <li>Self-respect - 5</li>

          <h3>Self Respect</h3>

          The Value which is most important to me is self respecct. Having self-respect gives the ability to love yourself for the real person you are on the inside, and not just for your looks or what you do for a living, or what you are able to do. When someone is lacking self-respect they experience feelings of regret, shame, anger, guilt, and blame. It is important to have self-respect if you want to love yourself fully and completely. When you have the ability to be proud of you who are, and believe that you have value as a human being, then you have self-respect.

          <h2>How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?</h2>

          <p> My values are more significant to me. I would consistently try to abide by my values which will bring better impact in my life and With no doubt the six values  will definitely help me mediate stereotype threat.</p>

          <p>Respecting ones self is a key to breakthrough our own fear.</p> 

          <p>Independent people naturally tend to be little more confident on handling issues and will be more likely to try out new things.</p>

          <p>Being persistent is a skill which can help us to reach a goal and get what we desire. Applying persistence to any task distinguishes between those who are successful and those who fail. Giving up too soon is one of the most common reason for failure.</p>

          <p>Personal development is a vital part in a person's growth. If we open ourself in learning personal development, we will become more positive in our outlook. we will start to create our life rather than letting circumstanes create it.</p>

          <p>Our reputation represents the way others look at us. It's hard to have friends if people think you're mean, lazy, unreliable or dishonest. A good reputation provides as a target at which to keep aiming.</p>

          <p>Being responsible is doing what needs to be done to take care of ourself, our family, friends and the community. Being responsible means that others can rely on us, that we follow through on our promises.</p>
