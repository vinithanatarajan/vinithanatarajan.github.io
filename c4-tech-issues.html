          <h2>Problems facing  the tech world</h2>

<h3>"The production of too many useful things results in too many useless people." - Karl Marx</h3>

<p>Technology is the creation, modification, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, and systems to solve a problem, improve a pre-existing solution or achieve a goal.

The Tech world is always facing problems. Some of these problems have slowly changed over time, but many of them are perennial offenders. Most technologies currently developed are beneficial for the human race.</p>

<p>In the last few years, cloud computing has grown from being a promising business concept to one of the fastest growing segments of the IT industry. Now, recession-hit companies are increasingly realising that simply by tapping into the cloud they can gain fast access to best-of-breed business applications or drastically boost their infrastructure resources, all at negligible cost. But as more and more information on individuals and companies is placed in the cloud, concerns are beginning to grow about just how safe an environment it is.</p>

<p>Google was forced to make an embarrassing apology in February when its Gmail service collapsed in Europe. While cloud service providers face similar security issues as other sorts of organisations, analysts warn that the cloud is becoming particularly attractive to cyber crooks. According to Datamonitor's Trifkovic the cloud is still very much a new frontier with very little in the way of specific standards for security or data privacy. What's more, many are concerned that cloud computing remains at such an embryonic stage that the imposition of strict standards could do more harm than good.</p>

<p>Here are some best solutions for companies in the cloud</p>

<li>Inquire about exception monitoring systems.</li>
<li>Be vigilant around updates and making sure that staff don't suddenly gain access privileges they're not supposed to.</li>
<li>Ask where the data is kept and inquire as to the details of data protection laws in the relevant jurisdictions.</li>
<li>Seek an independent security audit of the host.</li>
