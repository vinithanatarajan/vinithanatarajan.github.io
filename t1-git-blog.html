          Benefits of version control
Version control provides one method for an entire team to use, everybody operates under the same ground rules. It has the ability to track changes promotes accountability and makes it easier to find the right person to solve problems in the materials maintained.
A list for the exact changes that has been made can be generated quickly and easily from which the user can know how it has changed from version to version. It is also easy to roll back to an earlier version of the information.

Git is a system that saves the contents of the files in our project. It can reproduce the contents of our files exactly as we originally saved them, exactly. An unique, content encryption algorithm called "SHA-1" that turns any document's contents into a unique, 40 hex character compressed blob. It allows Git to quickly determine whether a file has changed by just looking at the name. It also means, since all SHA-1 is calculated the same on every computer, for every user, you can quickly and easily copy, or clone, and move an entire project to another computer, and it will be identical to the original content, exactly.

Whether we work on multiple computers or just want to get some old projects off our computer, GitHub is the perfect place to store our projects online.
